            <p>This technical documentation page has been created as a freeCodecamp certification project.</p>
            <p>After a prolonged struggle of not being able to pick a topic for the web-page, I have come up with a
                desision to write about margins and padding, because of the follwoing reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I have at least very basic knowledge of the topic (I sincerely hope so), thanks to my teachers, my
                    fellow classmates and the World Wide Web;</li>
                <li>The topic satisfies requirements for the certification project I am working on - will include
                    examples of code, fits into a technical documentation webpage description;</li>
                <li>This resource potentially can be used in the future as a reference for myself or someone else who is
                    studying html and css.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Overview" class="main-section">
            <header>Overview</header>
            <p>In the first section, the purpose and definition of margin and padding will be covered. Also, I will talk
                about "The Box Philosophy" a little. Samples of code will be included as well.</p>
            <p>The second section will reveal the mysteries of when you should use one or the other or both.</p>
            <p>In the third section I will provide some tips that I have found useful while working with margins and
                padding.</p>
            <p>The fifth section is acknowledgements and references.</p>

        <section id="Section_1:_Purpose_and_Definitions" class="main-section">
            <header>Section 1: Purpose and Definitions</header>
            <p>Margin and padding concepts are utilised in order to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create/remove the space between "outsides" of different html elements (margin);</li>
                <li>Create/remove the space within elements (padding).</li>
            </ul>
            <header class="subheader">The "Box Philosophy"</header>
            <p>One of my teachers had introduced my to a concept of "Box Phillosophy". The cornerstone of this doctrine
                is that everything in html (and maybe in life) is a box. Some boxes take the whole length of their
                parent elements (block-elements), some share line-space with neighbors (inline-elements). Some elements
                can take the whole screen! Margins and padding allow us to create and adjust the space between boxes. An
                absolutely cosmic concept, to be honest.</p>
            <p>Another important thing to remember, when things get a bit overwhelming emotionally, is that a chocolate
                box is a box too and so is the coffin.</p>
            <header class="subheader">Code Examples</header>
            <p>The size of the margin area is determined by the following properties that you can add in your css file:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"separate" properties <code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-right</code>,
                    <code>margin-bottom</code>, <code>margin-left</code>;</li>
                <li>shorthand property <code>margin</code> that incapsulates all the above.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can use <code>margin</code> shorthand property by specifying all four dimensions separated by a comma
                by typing either four values or three or two or one. Examples are below:</p>
            <p>Specifying top margin, left, right, bottom.</p>
            <pre><code>element {
margin: 1px 2px 1px 2px;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Specifying top margin, left&right, bottom.</p>
            <pre><code>element {
margin: 1px auto 2px;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Specifying top&bottom, left&right margins.</p>
            <pre><code>element {
margin: 1px auto;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Specifying all four margins.</p>
            <pre><code>element {
margin: 1px;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Same applies for padding.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Section_2:_Margin_vs_Padding" class="main-section">
            <header>Section 2: Margin vs Padding</header>
            <p>Another teacher of mine recommends to be consistent above all. If we you are using margins then stick to
                it, if it's padding which is your weapon of choice, then love it. Also, the same instructor had
                mentioned, that if working for or with someone, different web-developers often might have their own
                little strange preferences favouring either margins or padding.</p>
            <p>What I have learned after doing a couple of practice runs with certifications projects, mixing two
                together can make the document very messy, like Red Wedding from GoT. Pesronally, I prefer my layouts
                like I prefer my scotch: neat.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Section_3:_Tips_and_Tricks" class="main-section">
            <header>Section 3: Tips and Tricks</header>
            <p>Following the "Box Philosophy" it would be nice to see the actual boxes to better understand and identify
                margins, padding and just in general. I found enabling borders for <em>all</em> elements is very
                helpfull. This can easily be done with adding the following code in your CSS file (and removing later
                when it's not needed anymore):</p>
            <pre><code>* {
border: 1px solid black;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Makes a huge diffrence.</p>
